# Search Engine
Worked on a LA Times dataset - crawled the site to obtain webpages. Indexed the webpages using Solr/Lucene and built the front end of a search engine which takes in a query and returns the top results generated by Solr/Lucene's Page Rank functionality. The search engine has functionality like stop word elimination, auto-suggest and spell correct.
